#features

___Motivational imagery___

The images are designed to motivate and encourage a sense of ergency and determination using a lady pushing through a workout. It is suitable for this website as it aims to encourage one to take control over their wellbeing and fitness goals, starting by motivating/inspiring the viewers. It was delibertly chosen to include images that show a single individual exercising as to promote and carry on the theme of independance, which is the aim of the page.

___Motivational language___

The use of motivational speech is present in the first two sections, for instance, on the landing page, "Own your Fitness, put the power in your hands" promotes autonamy and being in control over ones fitness withot depending on anyone else. The title itself "Own your fitness" is short and catchy to give the general purpose of the page so users know what to expect. In the second section (Why you should join) carrys on with the same theme but in more detail, using words like "individual" and tailored" so users can expect programms that are individulised to their specific needs.

___the tools provided___

The page introduces aspects and beneits of the tools that is provided when signing up, which is to essentially design a tailored program for each indiividual user. This begins in the second section "Why you should join" and gives different reasons and benefits of joining the website, all centered around the theme of independence and owning ones fitnes journey. Along side providing a tailored programm, it shows users that they can log their progress to keep on track, so that they can maintain their fitness journey long term and adjust things along the way (important for maintaining independance).

___ A point regarding the 'community' aspect___
In the second section, there is a mention of an online community feature where users can share experiences. Although indepndance is the main aim of the page, it is felt important to consider that people are still social beings and like to share experiences. It is also felt this would not detere one from maintiang independance in their journey but to suppliment it with motivation and learn from other peoples experience who are, in fact, going through the same journey. It is felt very different to hiring a personal trainer who, essentialy, would be taking a clients fitness aspirations in his/her own hands.


___simple to use___

In the first, landing page, section, it shows the navigation anchor element on the top right hand of the page, identifying the pages 3 section, introduction, why/ join and signing-up. This enables users to swiftly navigate thorugh the page using these anchor elements. This is particulary useful if users are revisiting the page and know which section they want to go to, or when refering another user to, for instance, sign up straight away or even to find specific information on the page. 

In the second section, not only does it describe easy-to-use tools for obtaining a tailored program but also, just below the center image, is 3 steps to reaching this point, all simplified and easy to undertand. This part of the second section aims to show users the simplicity of using this page and that obtaining a programm will not take a significantly long time. If a user 

In the third section, if a user continues to the 'sign up' section, he/she will be presented with 7 boxes to fill out, 4 of which are perosnal details. The users, firstly will be able to see all the boxes in one page, showing the small amount of time is should take to complete the registeration and obtain their tailored program. Secondly, users can fill the boxs without needing to choose from a selction list, which means more tailored information can be obtained, without causing any complications in the process, as it is simple to use. It includes the 'hover' pseudo element for highlighting and to increase ease in the process, as-well enhancing the pages asathetics.

__footer__

The footer shows the social media icons, facebook, twitter, instagram and youtube, showing that the page is active on social media so users can follow up with updates, events, success stories, motivational videos, and generally keep them supporting and adhering to this web page and its cause. In addition to the simplicity of usage mentioned previously, the icons are all linked to the relavant pages that can be visited through a simple click of the icon, which means very little time is used by users to adhere to new posts. 

__future plans/improvment__

Within the sign-up form section, as it currently only provides users with empty boxes to fill in, some users may need more guidance, particularly within the sections regarding goals, fitness levels and considerations. A possible future improvement could include a list of options to choose alongisde the ability to choose their own options, as users could change their mind when seeing other avaiable options. It would need to be highlighted that the list of options are only examples and that users can still make their own choses, independent of what is shown in the list. The key is to still maintian the simplistic asthetics and impression of the page, keeping additional information/explanations short and simple as to not bore or confuse users.
